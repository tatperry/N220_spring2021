<!-- Dont know how this is not working. when viewing in inspect on google chrome it told me it had something to do with my app.js line 20, but there was nothing off about it everything works out. I have tried to retype everything over again and nothing is working. Possibly need help with this part. I would like to know how to make this work! -->
